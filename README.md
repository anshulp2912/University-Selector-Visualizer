# University-Selector-Visualizer

## Introduction
As people have started living more on the online world rather than the real world, it has resulted in the generation of tremendous amounts of data. Data is being collected from activities such as online surfing and surveys, online shopping tracking, transactional data tracking, market analysis, social media monitoring, and much more. To make sense out of this random data lying around, Data Visualization techniques are being implemented to help us take advantage of this goldmine which others think as trash.

## Why Data Visualization ?
When something gets too hard to even consider understanding, resorting to the uncomplicated language of data visualization rearranges everything to an idea we can get a handle on.
At the beginning of data representation, the best way to picture our data existed inside Excel’s abilities. You’d start with a convenient spreadsheet and gradually make an improved realistic to help pass on a message or comprehend a business pattern. It used to be the best device out there until data developed to a point that Excel couldn’t deal with its size, and experts required more complex representations than a pie, line, or bar representation. This is the point at which the cutting edge period of data visualization started. It took off at an unfaltering pace and has just picked up steam over the most recent couple of years.
Some benefits of Data Visualization:
- Allows to tell a visual story
- Can be personalized for each user
- Helps finding the outliers
- Helps keep audience engaged
- Helps make important decisions
- Helps provide gist of the data

## Data Visualization Tools
This section discusses about a novel data visualization tool called Tableau. Tableau is an amazing and quickest developing information perception tool utilized in the Business Intelligence Workspace. It helps in streamlining crude information into an effectively justifiable arrangement. Information analytics is exceptionally quick with Tableau and the perceptions made are as dashboards and worksheets.

## Problem Statement
I will discuss my personal problem for which I created a graph to visualize the data. Since, I was planning to attend graduate school for higher studies in United States of America. There are around 2000 universities in the United States alone which are granting Masters Degree so to decide which are the best ones among them is a difficult task.

## Solution
So, I took the task to differentiate these universities based on parameters. QS World University Rankings being the trustable source for rankings, have made an excel sheet ranking around 81 top universities for Computer Science based Academic Score, Employer Score, Citation Score, H-Score, and Overall Score. Additionally, to this list of features I added my own features such as the City, State, and the fees of the university.
Comparing these many universities based on various parametric features just by using sorting filters is a difficult task, therefore data visualisation is the best way to go around this data. I imported the excel sheet into Tableau and created a new dashboard to visualize it. I selected a graph that maps city and state of the university on United States emphasizing on its geographical location, and assigned the employer rating as the size of the circle and forged feature of Score/Fees as colour of the circle representing the University.
